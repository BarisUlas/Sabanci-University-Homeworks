A double-precision IEEE number is stored in memory address X (see the code in “lab_2.s”). Write a sequence of MIPS instructions to divide the floating number at X by (-8), prints out the result and store the result back at X. Accomplish this without using any floating-point instructions (assume that overflow doesn’t occur). See the code in “lab_2.s” to move the double-precision floating-point number to integer registers.
